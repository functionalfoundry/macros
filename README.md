A collection of Clojure and ClojureScript macros (and related utilities)
for web and mobile development. The main goal of these macros is to
provide all main, high-level building blocks of an application:

* Data (`defentity`)
* Permissions (`defpermission`)
* Services (`defservice`)
* Commands / Actions (`defcommand`)
* Views (`defview`)
* Screens (`defscreen`)

How the building blocks created using these macros are combined into
working applications is left open. All macros provide hooks to make
this as easy as possible.
